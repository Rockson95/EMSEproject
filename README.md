- A system to detect Chronic Respiratory diesases in patients.

- FRONTEND: HTML, CSS AND JavaScript. 

- Other options I want to consider for the frontend is React JS, Vue.js

- Backend: MongoDB for the database, Nodejs for the backend and then hosting the API. / Springboot for the backend.
- I have decided to use spring boot for my project. Spring boot comes with framework like spring core, spring data, spring cloud, spring security and spring integration.
